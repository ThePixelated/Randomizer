# Randomizer for C++
### Welcome !!
This project is an attempt for me to make a random number generator in C++.
There is going to be a different version of it, and yes, this generator may not be the best
and probably using some technique that aren't suppose to do but yeah, this is my attempt
to make a "randomly" generated number (because I'm so frustated of how difficult it is to get a random number in cpp).

Currently I just focusing on making this as a function but in the future i'll try to make it as a class

(honestly I don't know what I'm talking about.. wish me luck)
